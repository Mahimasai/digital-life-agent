🚀 What I Worked On Today (a.k.a. Mahima Becomes a Tech Superhero)

Created my frontend, backend, and docs folders like a true project architect 🏗️😎

Built the Galaxy UI (YES, A WHOLE UNIVERSE 🌌) and ran it on localhost

Started exploring the tools that will become my new best friends (Next.js, CodeRabbit, Vercel)

Opened my first Pull Request and CodeRabbit looked at my code like: “Haan beta, reviewing!” 🐰🤓

⚙️ Technical Tasks Completed (Feeling Like Iron Man in His Garage)

🎨 Set up Next.js frontend

💅 Installed Tailwind + Framer Motion

🌌 Created a Galaxy UI with floating planets (Email, Tasks, Planner)

🖥️ Ran everything on localhost — AND IT WORKED 😭🔥

🐰 Triggered CodeRabbit for the first time through a PR

⚔️ Faced my first merge conflict like a warrior

🧠 What New Things I Learned (Brain EXPANDED 💥)

How Next.js project structure works

Why App Router is both my villain and my guru at the same time 😭🫡

How to create PRs, branches, and trigger CodeRabbit

That Tailwind + Framer Motion combo is DEADLY SMOOTH 🔥

That localhost success hits harder than coffee

🐛 Problems I Faced (Drama + Pain + Victory)

Problem: README.md conflict in PR My Reaction: “BROO WHY IS GITHUB FIGHTING WITH ME 😭” Solution: Realized conflicts happen when I update same file on different branches — fixed using the conflict editor like a queen 👑

Problem: UI not showing at first My Reaction: “This code is haunted or what?” 👻 Solution: Restarted server, reinstalled deps — everything magically worked again ✨

📸 Screenshots / Outputs

Galaxy UI in all its cosmic glory 🌌

CodeRabbit review check showing up for the first time 🐰⚡

Merge conflict warning (my first official GitHub battlefield moment) ⚔️💀

😄 My Experience / Feelings (Full Bollywood Emotions)

Broooo today was INSANE 😭🔥
I started with “Ok, let’s build something.”
Then suddenly → I had planets floating on my screen??
LIKE WHAT??? 😭🪐🔥

I actually felt like a student discovering a whole new magical world of tech. Every small win felt like:

“Yehhhhhh I DID ITTTT!” 🥳💃

And honestly… I’m already addicted to this project. Tomorrow? EVEN MORE FIRE 🔥🔥🔥

💖 Special Thanks To The Tech Gods of Day 1
